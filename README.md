# Primal Dual Algorithm for Weighted Set Cover
A primal dual algorithm for weighted set cover. Especially for the case when the number of sets an element can occur in is limited (like in Vertex Cover for which this algorithm is a 2-APX).

# Primal Dual Algorithm for Uncapacitated Facility Loation Problem
Will check tight example.

This is a simple implementation for Set Cover and Facility Location Problem.
Set cover code borrow from https://github.com/d-krupke/primal_dual_weighted_set_cover.
I implement the facility location part. This algorithm believed to achieve 1.61-approximation guarantee
Will paste test based on tight example tonight.
